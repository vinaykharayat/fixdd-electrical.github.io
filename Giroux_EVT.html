			<p>Edison developed direct current — current that runs continually in a single direction, like in a battery
				or a fuel cell. During the early years of electricity, direct current (shorthanded as DC) was the
				standard in the U.S.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section-4">
			<p>Edison’s enduring legacy isn’t a specific patent or technology, but his invention factories, which
				divided the innovation process into small tasks that were carried out by legions of workers, he invents
				modern innovation as we know it.</p>

		<section class="section-3" style="display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse;">

			<p>Tesla had an eidetic memory, which meant he could very precisely recall images and objects. This enabled
				him to accurately visualize intricate 3D objects, and as a result, he could build working prototypes
				using few preliminary drawings.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section-4">
			<p>But there was one problem. Direct current is not easily converted to higher or lower voltages. Tesla
				believed that alternating current (or AC) was the solution to this problem. Alternating current reverses
				direction a certain number of times per second — 60 in the U.S. — and can be converted to different
				voltages relatively easily using a transformer.</p>

		<section class="section-7">
			<div class="sec-7a">
				<img src="./images/blue-arrow.png" width="50px">
				<p>Edison, not wanting to lose the royalties he was earning from his direct current patents, began a
					campaign to discredit alternating current. He spread misinformation going so far as to publicly
					electrocute stray animals using alternating current to prove his point.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sec-7b">
				<img src="./images/blue-arrow.png" width="50px">
				<p>General Electric bid to electrify the fair using Edison’s direct current for $554,000, but lost to
					George Westinghouse, who said he could power the fair for only $399,000 using Tesla’s alternating
					current</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sec-7c">
				<img src="./images/blue-arrow.png" width="50px">
				<p>Same year, the Niagara Falls Power Company decided to award Westinghouse who had licensed Tesla’s
					polyphase AC induction motor patent. Although some doubted but Tesla was convinced it could power
					not only Buffalo, but also the entire Eastern US.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section class="section-8">
			<img src="./images/train_icon.png" width="120px">
			<p>On Nov. 16, 1896, Buffalo was lit up by the alternating current from Niagara Falls. By this time General
				Electric had decided to jump on the alternating current train, too.</p>
			<p>It would appear that alternating current had all but obliterated direct current, but in recent years
				direct current has seen a bit of a renaissance.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section-9">
			<div class="quote">
				<img src="./images/quote_icon.png" width="50px">
				<p>Today our electricity is still predominantly powered by alternating current, but computers, LEDs,
					solar cells and electric vehicles all run on DC power. And methods are now available for converting
					direct current to higher and lower voltages. Since direct current is more stable, companies are
					finding ways of using high voltage direct current (HVDC) to transport electricity long distances
					with less electricity loss.</p>
			</div>

		<section class="section-10">
			<p>So it appears the War of the Currents may not be over yet. But instead of continuing in a heated AC vs.
				DC battle, it looks like the two currents will end up working parallel to each other in a sort of hybrid
				armistice.</p>
