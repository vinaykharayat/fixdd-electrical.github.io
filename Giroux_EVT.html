			<p>Edison’s enduring legacy isn’t a specific patent or technology, but his invention factories, which divided the innovation process into small tasks that were carried out by legions of workers, he invents modern innovation as we know it.</p>

			<p>Edison developed direct current — current that runs continually in a single direction, like in a battery or a fuel cell. During the early years of electricity, direct current (shorthanded as DC) was the standard in the U.S.</p>
		</section>
	
		<section class="section-5">
			<img src="./images/tesla_small.jpeg" width="100px" height="120px">
			<p>Tesla had an eidetic memory, which meant he could very precisely recall images and objects. This enabled him to accurately visualize intricate 3D objects, and as a result, he could build working prototypes using few preliminary drawings.</p>
		</section>
	
		<section class="section-6">
			<p>But there was one problem. Direct current is not easily converted to higher or lower voltages.
			Tesla believed that alternating current (or AC) was the solution to this problem. Alternating current reverses direction a certain number of times per second — 60 in the U.S. — and can be converted to different voltages relatively easily using a transformer.</p>

			<div class="sec-7a">
				<img src="./images/blue-arrow.png" width="50px">
				<p>Edison, not wanting to lose the royalties he was earning from his direct current patents, began a campaign to discredit alternating current. He spread misinformation going so far as to publicly electrocute stray animals using alternating current to prove his point.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sec-7b">
				<img src="./images/blue-arrow.png" width="50px">
				<p>General Electric bid to electrify the fair using Edison’s direct current for $554,000, but lost to George Westinghouse, who said he could power the fair for only $399,000 using Tesla’s alternating current</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sec-7c">
				<img src="./images/blue-arrow.png" width="50px">
				<p>Same year, the Niagara Falls Power Company decided to award Westinghouse who had licensed Tesla’s polyphase AC induction motor patent. Although some doubted but Tesla was convinced it could power not only Buffalo, but also the entire Eastern US.</p>
			</div>

		<section class="section-8">
			<img src="./images/train_icon.png" width="120px">
			<p>On Nov. 16, 1896, Buffalo was lit up by the alternating current from Niagara Falls. By this time General Electric had decided to jump on the alternating current train, too.</p>
			<p>It would appear that alternating current had all but obliterated direct current, but in recent years direct current has seen a bit of a renaissance.</p>

		<section class="section-9">
			<div class="quote">
				<img src="./images/quote_icon.png" width="50px">
				<p>Today our electricity is still predominantly powered by alternating current, but computers, LEDs, solar cells and electric vehicles all run on DC power. And methods are now available for converting direct current to higher and lower voltages. Since direct current is more stable, companies are finding ways of using high voltage direct current (HVDC) to transport electricity long distances with less electricity loss.</p>

		<section class="section-10">
			<p>So it appears the War of the Currents may not be over yet. But instead of continuing in a heated AC vs. DC battle, it looks like the two currents will end up working parallel to each other in a sort of hybrid armistice.</p>
